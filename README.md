# gdso-avito
Predicting the demand for listed items in Avito (Russian Craigslist) from a
combination of tabular, text and image data. This is for example to set the
seller's expectation based on their listing.

This is a Kaggle competition ( https://www.kaggle.com/c/avito-demand-prediction )
that we do during the data science workshop held by graduate data science organization (GDSO) where students and postdocs form
 teams of 4 mentored by data scientists from industry to work on some practical
 problems while learning to use their data science skills, network and have fun!
